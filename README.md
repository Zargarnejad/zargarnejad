# 👋 Hi there, I'm Monireh!

I'm currently a full-stack web development trainee at [HackYourFuture](https://www.hackyourfuture.dk/) in Copenhagen 🇩🇰 — with a strong passion for **front-end development**.

I worked as a **customer trainer and support specialist** more than 11 years, where I developed a deep understanding of **real user needs, pain points, and expectations**. This experience, combined with my growing skills in web development, makes me especially focused on **building interfaces that are intuitive, accessible, and human-centered**.
